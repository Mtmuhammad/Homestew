                A gluten-free diet is an eating plan that excludes foods containing gluten and is essential for managing signs and symptoms of celiac disease and other medical conditions associated with gluten.. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye and triticale (a cross between wheat and rye).

                “Ketogenic” is a term for a low-carb diet (like the Atkins diet). The idea is for you to get more calories from protein and fat and less from carbohydrates. You cut back most on the carbs that are easy to digest, like sugar, soda, pastries, and white bread.

                A paleo diet typically includes lean meats, fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds — foods that in the past could be obtained by hunting and gathering. A paleo diet limits foods that became common when farming emerged about 10,000 years ago. These foods include dairy products, legumes and grains.
